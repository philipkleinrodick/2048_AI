## Summary

## Objectives
* Build an artificial intelligence to play the game 2048
* Build an artificial intelligence to play the game 2048 WELL (ie achieve a high score)
* Implement a deep q neural network

### How to play 2048

The rules of the game are quite simple.  You start with a four by four grid initially filled with two '2' tiles.  Then make a move up, down, left, or right.  All of the tiles will shift in the designated direction.  Tiles of the same value will combine into a single tile of twice the value.  If there are any empty tiles, a single new tile will be added.  The new tile will be a '2' with a probability of 90 percent and '4' with a probability of 10 percent.  Each time two tiles are merged, the value of the resultant tile is added to your score.
